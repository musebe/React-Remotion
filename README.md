# Creating Videos using React.js and Remotion
Videos enable us to establish authority and a more personal feel to your message. It enables us to connect with the emotional levels of our audience. React is a great JavaScript library for describing User Interfaces that change over time. To create video content programmatically with React.js

We are going to use an amazing tool called Remotion.

Letâ€™s explore how we can achieve this.

## Github

Check out this [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/874bowen/Remotion-Videos.git) for the complete source code.

## Pre-requisites
Below are some requirements you are to meet to follow along this article: 
- Basic knowledge of JavaScript
- Basic knowledge of React.js

## Setting Up the Sample Project
In your preferred directory, create a new remotion project using `yarn create video` 

You might want to choose the recommended template but for the purposes of this choose a _blank_ template. Run `yarn start` This will start the local dev server running. You will see a window like this.

On the left we have a sidebar showing all the compositions for our project which allows you to isolate and inspect each scene in the video. Each composition is a renderable component. A composition is made up of sequences which tell the video which frames to display the content in. The entry point of a remotion project is the `index.tsx` here we call the function `registerRoot(RemotionVideo);` which is in the `Video.tsx`

## Introduction
Open the `Video.tsx` file. This file contains the `RemotionVideo` component. You can think of this component as your entire video.
```javascript
export const RemotionVideo: React.FC = () => {
    return (
        <>
            <Composition 
                id="Empty"
                component={MyComposition}
                durationInFrames={450}
                fps={30}
                width={1280}
                height={720}
            />
        </>
    );
};
```
A video is basically made up of one or more compositions. within the composition we define video properties the `durationInFrames` which is the number of frames which the video will take, `fps` which is the number of frames per second, `width` and `height` of the video in pixels. 

>When we talk of frames you  can think of it as a still image at a given point in the video. 

The `id` identifies the composition in the video player and references the component that contains the UI that you want to show. The width and height properties are used to change the resolution of the video e.g., to change the resolution to portrait 
```
    width={1080}
    height={1920}
```
The actual length of the video in seconds is based on the fps. `durationInFrames / fps = length(s)` This implies that for this demo our video is 15 seconds long `450 / 30 = 15`.

## Customizing the Video
We are going to create new `Main` component  just below the `RemotionVideo` component.
```javascript
const Main = () => {
    return <h1>Welcome to Cloudinary!</h1>
}
```
To view this on your browser you will have to change the value of the id from `id="Empty"` to `id="Main"` also the component value to `component={Main}` When you change the id value you will also have to change the `package.json` file 

```
"build": "remotion render src/index.tsx Empty out/video.mp4"
```
to have the value of the id
```
"build": "remotion render src/index.tsx Main out/video.mp4"
```
Once you open the video player you will see the video with the text `Welcome to Cloudinary`. 
To modify the css styling of your video programmatically use inline CSS.
```javascript
const Main = () => {
    return (
        <div style={{backgroundColor: 'white', flexGrow: 1}}>
            <h1 
                style={{
                    position: 'absolute', 
                    top: '50%', 
                    width: '100%', 
                    textAlign: 'center', 
                    fontSize: '5rem',
                }}
            >Welcome to Cloudinary!</h1>
        </div>
    );
};
```
We can have three components for this particular video the `Title`, `SubTitle` and the `Image` then call them inside the `Main` component.
```javascript
const Title = () => {
	return(
        <h1 
            style={{
                position: 'absolute',
                top: '50%',
                width: '100%',
                textAlign: 'center',
                fontSize: '5rem',
            }}
        >Welcome to Cloudinary!</h1>
    );
}
const SubTitle = () => {
	return(
        <h3
            style={{
                position: 'absolute',
                top: '60%',
                width: '100%',
                textAlign: 'center',
                fontSize: '3rem',
	    }}
        >Transform images and videos to load faster with no visual degradation, automatically generate image and video variants, and deliver high quality responsive experiences to increase conversions.</h3>
    );
}
```
To add images and render them we have to use `Img` tag which shoud be imported from Remotion.
```javascript
import {Composition, Img} from 'remotion';
import cloudinary from './cloudinary.png';
```
We can then create the `Image` Component
```javascript
const Image = () => {
	return(
        <Img 
            src={cloudinary} alt='cloudinary' 
            style={{
                display: 'block', 
                marginLeft: 'auto', 
                marginRight: 'auto', 
                width: '30%', 
                height: '50%',
            }}
        />
    );
}
const Main = () => {
    return (
        <div style={{backgroundColor: 'white', flexGrow: 1}}>
            <Title />
            <Image />
            <SubTitle />
        </div>
    );
};
```
For now everything we need for this video is set, but we need to do some animation to make create our video cool and interesting.

## Animation
To make up our entire video clip we are going to use `Sequences`, these are small individual sections in finite time that make up our entire video. We then specify the time we from which we want a component to show using `from={0}` This means it will start to show at the start(0 seconds). You can also specify the time you want the component to disappear using `durationInFrames={60}` attribute.
```html
<div style={{backgroundColor: 'white', flexGrow: 1}}>
    <Sequence from={0}>
        <Image />
    </Sequence>
    <Sequence from={60}>
        <Title />
    </Sequence>
    <Sequence from={120}>
    <SubTitle />
    </Sequence>	
</div>
```

### Adding Audio for our Video
We can simply add videos using the `<Audio />` tag in Remotion. Let's add a `Voice` component to render the voice.
```javascript
import {Composition, Img, Audio} from 'remotion';
import voice from './voice.mp3';
// rest of the code
const AudVoice = () => {
    return (
        <Audio src={voice} startFrom={0} endAt={30*15}/>
    );
};
// other code
```

Remotion provides a variety of different hooks which enable us to provide data about the video.
> useVideoConfig() hook enables us grab data about the `fps`,
> `durationInFrames`, `width`, and `height`. We can use this to calculate values for animation our frames.
> 
> useCurrentFrame() hook gives us the current frame and the timeline. These frames will be re-rendered for each time in the video.

For now your video player is playing well but we now need to use the data about the video in place of the natural numbers 0, 60 and 90. Import `useVideo` from remotion.
```javascript
const Main = () => {
    const {fps, durationInFrames} = useVideoConfig();
    return (
        <div style={{backgroundColor: 'white', flexGrow: 1}}>
            <Sequence from={fps*0.3} durationInFrames={durationInFrames}>
                <Image />
            </Sequence>
            <Sequence from={fps} durationInFrames={durationInFrames}>
                <AudVoice />
            </Sequence>
            <Sequence from={fps} durationInFrames={durationInFrames}>
                <Title />
            </Sequence>
            <Sequence from={fps*2} durationInFrames={durationInFrames}>
                <Subtitle />
            </Sequence>
        </div>
    );
}
```
### Fade-In effect on the SubTitle
Let's make our animation more captivating with a fade in effect. Here we'll use the `useCurrentFrame()` hook as shown.
```javascript
const SubTitle = () => {
	const frame = useCurrentFrame();
	const opacity = frame > 30 ? 1 : frame / 30;
	return(
        <h3
 	style={{
		position: 'absolute',
		top: '60%',
		width: '100%',
		textAlign: 'center',
		fontSize: '3rem',
		opacity
	}}
 >Transform images and videos to load faster with no visual degradation, automatically generate image and video variants, and deliver high quality responsive experiences to increase conversions.</h3>
	);
}
```
useCurrentFrame brings back the current frame which is `SubTitle` in the context of the sequence.
```javascript
const frame = useCurrentFrame();
```
We want the opacity to be zero at the start then as time goes it becomes one. If the frame is greater than 30 then return the opacity as 1. Otherwise, have the opacity as `frame/30`
```javascript
const opacity = frame > 30 ? 1 : frame / 30;
```

### Bounce effect on the Image

```javascript
const Image = () => {
	const frame = useCurrentFrame();
	const {fps} = useVideoConfig();
	const translate = spring({frame, fps, to: 100})
	return(
        <Img 
            src={cloudinary} alt='cloudinary' 
            style={{
                display: 'block', 
                marginLeft: 'auto', 
                marginRight: 'auto', 
                width: '30%', 
                height: '50%', 
                transform: `translateY(${translate}px)`
            }}
        />
    );
}
```
The `spring` function makes our component to bounce from a point to a point. We'll get the `fps` from the hook as shown. The function takes the `frame` and `fps` so that it knows how fast to go, `from` and `to` tells you how much range you want the outputs to be, `from` has a default value of zero.  

## Building our Project
To build our project run `yarn build` or `npm run build` on your terminal. This has a dependency on `ffmpeg`, the terminal will give you instructions on how to configure it on your machine.

Once done you will find the video inside the `out` folder of your project.

## Conclusion
Great! In this article we managed to create a 15 second video without using any video editing tools just React. It's amazing how we can create videos using react, right?
